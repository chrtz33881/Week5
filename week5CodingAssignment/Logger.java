//Coding Steps — Object Oriented Programming:
//1. Create an interface named Logger.

public interface Logger	{

//2. Add two void methods to the Logger interface, each should take a String as an argument
//        a. Log
//        b. Error

public void log(String message);
public void error (String message);


//    3. Create two classes that implement the Logger interface
//        a. AsteriskLogger
//        b. SpacedLogger


//    4. The log method on the AsteriskLogger should print out the String it receives between 3 asterisks on either side of the String (e.g. if the String passed in is “Hello”, then it should print ***Hello*** to the console).



//    5. The error method on the AsteriskLogger should print the String it receives inside a box of asterisks, with the String preceded by the word “ERROR:”. For example, if “Hello” is the argument, the following should be printed:
//
//****************
//***Error: Hello***
//****************
//    6. The SpacedLogger should add spaces between each character of the String argument passed into its methods.
//    7. If the log method received “Hello” as an argument, it should print H e l l o
//    8. The error method should do the same, but with “ERROR:” preceding the spaced out input (i.e. ERROR: H e l l o)
//    9. Create a class named App that has a main method.
//    10. In this class instantiate an instance of each of your logger classes that implement the Logger interface.
//    11. Test both methods on both instances, passing in Strings of your choice.
